**Przetwarzanie danych ustrukturyzowanych** - IAD 2 sem

**Preprocessing of structured data** - part of Data Science Studies, 2nd semester, Warsaw University of Technology

Used technologies:
- R, including packages: dplyr, data.table, sqldf
- Python, including libraries: numpy, pandas, and many more

The "pdu" repository contains materials related to the course on preprocessing of structured data. It is a part of the Data Science Studies curriculum at Warsaw University of Technology.

The repository includes the following components:

## R Learning Path
The R learning path provides a foundation for understanding data preprocessing techniques using R. It covers the basics of R programming and demonstrates the usage of popular R packages such as dplyr, data.table, and sqldf. The focus is on implementing SQL queries in R and showcasing the significant performance advantages of using R over traditional SQL approaches.

## Python Projects
In addition to the R learning path, the repository also contains Python projects related to data preprocessing. These projects primarily focus on text data preprocessing, showcasing techniques for handling and cleaning textual data.

## Projects
The repository includes the following projects:

1. **Project 1** - *Przetwarzanie danych ustrukturyzowanych w R* (Structured Data Processing in R): This project involves implementing SQL queries in R using popular R libraries. The detailed task description can be found in the PDF file located in the "pro1" folder. The project demonstrates the significant speed advantage of using R over SQL for data processing tasks.

2. **Project 2** - *Airline Performance Data Analysis*: This project is stored in a separate repository with the same name. It is a more advanced project that involves analyzing a large dataset of airline performance data. The project includes the creation of various interactive and non-interactive charts as well as CSV files containing the results of the analysis. The project is summarized in a concise presentation.

3. **Project 3** - idea simmilar to project's one, however this time all necessary funtions are implemented in python using pandas and sqlite3 packages.

These projects provide practical experience in data preprocessing techniques using R and Python, showcasing the advantages of each language in different scenarios. They aim to enhance understanding and proficiency in handling structured data and performing preprocessing tasks as part of the Data Science curriculum.
